# TESS-W4C
4-channel TESS-W photometer.
TESS-W4C is a variant of TESS-W with four channels. Three other channels are added to the integral channel to have RGB.
Like the one-channel models, this photometer sends the readings to the STARS4ALL network , and in parallel it can also be consulted locally.
